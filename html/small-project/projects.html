            <H3>Online Ticket Booking Management System(2020-2021)</H3>
            <p>It was my major project during my 6 Semesters. I used some different platforms and did work in the group.</p>
            <p>I built this project for several reasons. Which was very useful for time saving and improving work and
                health efficancy by booking tickets and hotels and cabs from home.</p>

            <h3>Traffic Flow Management Using Wireless Sensor Network(2020-2021)</h3>
            <p>It was a minor project in that we build a new traffic signal design in which we explain an updated
                timeline by counting waiting vehicles.</p>
            <p>We made some charts, canvases, prototypes.</p>
